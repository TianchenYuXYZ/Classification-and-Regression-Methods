# Classification-and-Regression-Methods

Our second assignment is focused on learning how to build from scratch classification and regression models. In the first part of the assignment, you are expected to preprocess, analyze visualize datasets, this is one of the first and core steps in machine learning pipeline. In the second part, you will implement logistic regression and test it on a Penguin dataset. In the third part, you will implement linear regression using ordinary least squares and in the fourth part, you will extend it to a ridge regression.
The goal of this assignment is to practice performing data analysis, implementing logistic classification, and understanding the practical implementation of different regression models.
For this assignment, sklearn or any other libraries with in-built functions that help to implement ML methods cannot be used. Submissions with used ML libraries (e.g. sklearn) will not be evaluated.
